        <h2>Facts of Dogs</h2>
        <p>1. Dogs Are Descendants of Wolves Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are direct descendants of wolves and share about 99.9% of their DNA with them. The domestication of dogs began over 15,000 years ago, likely as humans and wolves formed mutually
            beneficial hunting relationships.</p>
        <P>2. Dogs Have an Extraordinary Sense of Smell A dog’s sense of smell is estimated to be between 10,000 and 100,000 times better than that of humans. Some breeds, like bloodhounds, have over 300 million scent receptors, making them excellent trackers.</P>
        <p>3. Dogs Sweat Through Their Paws While dogs primarily regulate their body temperature through panting, they also sweat through the pads on their paws. This is one of the few places on their bodies where sweat glands are located.</p>
        <p>4. Dogs Can Understand Human Emotions Research has shown that dogs can recognize and respond to human emotions, especially sadness and joy. They can read facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language to understand how their owners are feeling.</p>
        <p>5. Each Dog’s Nose Print is Unique Just like human fingerprints, each dog has a unique nose print. Some companies have even started using nose prints as a form of identification for lost or stolen dogs.</p>
        <p>6. Dogs Dream, Too Studies suggest that dogs experience dreams similarly to humans. You may notice your dog twitching, growling, or moving its paws while asleep—these are signs that they're likely dreaming.</p>
        <p>7. Puppies Are Born Deaf and Blind When puppies are born, they cannot see or hear. Their eyes remain closed for about two weeks, and their hearing develops a few days after they open their eyes.</p>
        <p>8. Dogs Have Three Eyelids Dogs have a third eyelid called the "haw" or nictitating membrane. This helps protect their eyes from dirt and debris, and it also keeps their eyes moist.</p>
        <p>9. Some Breeds Can Run Extremely Fast Greyhounds are the fastest dog breed, capable of running up to 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). They have been bred for centuries for hunting and racing due to their incredible speed.</p>
        <p>10. Dogs See the World in a Different Color Spectrum While it's a myth that dogs only see in black and white, they do perceive fewer colors than humans. Dogs are believed to see shades of blue and yellow but have difficulty distinguishing between
            red and green.</p>
        <p>11. Dogs Can Be Left or Right-Pawed Just like humans are typically right- or left-handed, dogs can show a preference for using one paw over the other. You can observe this by watching which paw they use first when they perform tasks like stepping
            over obstacles.</p>
        <p>12. Dogs Have a "Sixth Sense" Many dog owners believe that their pets have an intuitive ability to sense changes in the environment or mood. Some dogs have been known to alert their owners to impending natural disasters, illnesses, or even seizures
            before they occur.</p>
        <p>13. Dogs Are Excellent Swimmers While not all dogs are naturally inclined to swim, many breeds, especially retrievers, are great swimmers. They can use their powerful limbs and bodies to propel themselves efficiently through the water.</p>
        <p>14. Dogs Can Detect Diseases With their exceptional sense of smell, dogs can be trained to detect certain diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and even COVID-19. Studies show that dogs can sniff out chemical changes in the body, sometimes even before
            symptoms appear.</p>
        <p>15. Dogs Have Been to Space Laika, a stray dog from Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth in 1957 aboard the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2. While the mission proved that living beings could survive in space, unfortunately, Laika did not
            return safely.</p>
